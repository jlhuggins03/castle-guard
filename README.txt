Hello,
Thank you for coming to the README file to READ ME.
If you desire to look through my code, you will find Comment blocks of things that I tried to implement
Within these blocks I have attempted code and Reasons why I decided not to implement. Other Comment blocks are
also placed throughout the classes, and these have mini explanations to what they do/ why they exist. I wrote
these blocks in the file order of: Boot.js, Menu.js, Play.js, Arrow.js, Dragon.js, and with minor details in
main.js

Finally I will also give credit to the artists whose work are used in the Modded game; and to the inspirations and help
that got the Mod to work and be finsished below the closer.

Thank you and Have a nice Day.
-Josh Huggins

P.S Though I may have few commits on this project, its because I didn't trust pushing it and 
    accidently writing over Rocket Patrol, like I did before.

P.P.S I wanted to try and implement all mods, but I found that getting 100 points was easier another way.

P.P.P.S I know that I have a "texture already in use error" its because the textures are loaded on a different scene. DO NOT WORRY.
